    <h1>My Goat - Lionel Messi</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Lionel Messi</strong> is my <strong>GOAT</strong> for various
      reasons. At club level he has won everything there is to win at the
      highest level of futbol. At international level he was ridiculed for not
      winning any major international trophies such as the World Cup and the
      Copa America. However, that all changed when in 2021 he won the Copa
      America with Argentina. A year later he achieved his dream winning the
      World Cup which resulted in mainstream recognition of his
      <strong>GOAT</strong> status in the game. But more than the statistics and
      trophies he's won, the way he plays the game, the way he caresses and
      moves with the ball, is unique unlike something I've ever seen. In my eyes
      he is a <strong>total futbol player</strong>, he can do almost everything
      in the game. <br />
